The core part of certifications is testing your knowledge against something and not a guesswork. It should be possible to look up things you don't know from something, whether a book of knowledge or whitepapers and documentations. PMI notoriously tests against their massive paper books, whether knowing and applying formulas or understanding what steps are including in the M&O phase of a project. AWS, however, references their documentation, white papers, blog posts, and everything they list out, so knowing what DAX is or when to use ECS instead of EKS are in all kinds of documentation."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Some other certifications lack this, like the original Comptia A+ (which has since changed), which just assumed you knew how to build computers and learned what PCI is from…somewhere. These don't help any more than just the tribal knowledge of computers, which is relatively untestable and highly opinionated. The move towards a more standardized A+ both helped make it valid but also showed how weak it is of a certification compared to big league ones. However, what determines it as big league?

Likewise, the PMP helps improve what pieces of the project need to be used and which pieces can stand aside.
