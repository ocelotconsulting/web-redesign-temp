So, bought the truck, drove it off the lot and to home. Seeing as it was a newer truck, it was actually a nicer drive than my old car. Got it home and parked it just fine. However, the next day, I needed to drive it to the office which had some minor struggles. I was used to the smaller space my car took and the fact I didn’t need quite the same clearance room to change lanes and I didn’t want to be “that guy with a truck” all over the interstate.

However, today in 2023, I can take the camper many places and I am no longer concerned about driving it, but rather did I remember to pack everything. As you look to adapt to new tools to ensure reliability and the ability to pull your organization to your vision, just realize there will be a time they slow down and learn. During this time, the whole organization will need to adapt to a new way of thinking.
